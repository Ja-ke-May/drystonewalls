      Here are some of the main types of wall you might come across in the UK:

          <div>  
          <p id="single-wall" className='text-green-600 text-lg'><strong>Single Wall (Single Dyke)</strong></p> 
          <div className='w-full flex justify-center mt-2 mb-4'>

      className='max-h-60 max-w-60 md:max-w-80 md:max-h-80 lg:max-h-96 lg:max-w-96'
       />
      </div>
            <p className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>A single wall, often referred to as a single dyke, is a basic form of wall construction where stones or bricks are laid in a single line. This type of wall is typically used for simple boundary demarcation or to keep livestock contained. The construction process involves carefully selecting and placing stones so that they interlock naturally, providing stability without the use of mortar. These walls rely on the weight and friction between stones to maintain their structure.

            <p id="double-wall" className='text-green-600 text-lg mt-4'><strong>Double Wall (Double Dyke)</strong></p>   
            <div className='w-full flex justify-center mt-2 mb-4'>
      <img 
      src='../images/drawings/double-dyke-side-cross.png' 
      alt='drawing of double dyke dry stone wall'
      className='max-h-60 max-w-60 md:max-w-80 md:max-h-80 lg:max-h-96 lg:max-w-96'
       />
      </div>
            <p className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>A double wall, or double dyke, is more complex and robust than a single wall. It consists of two parallel walls with a gap in between, which is filled with smaller stones or fill. This filling acts as a stabilizer, ensuring the walls remain upright and strong. Double walls are commonly used in regions with harsh weather conditions or where additional durability is needed. The two walls support each other, distributing pressure and reducing the likelihood of collapse.

            <p id="galloway-dyke" className='text-green-600 text-lg mt-4'><strong>Galloway Dyke</strong></p>
            <div className='w-full flex justify-center mt-2 mb-4'>
      <img

      className='max-h-60 max-w-60 md:max-w-80 md:max-h-80 lg:max-h-96 lg:max-w-96'
       />
      </div>
            <p className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>Galloway walls are renowned for their unique construction, featuring a double stack of small stones topped with a single stack of large stones. Despite this unconventional arrangement, these walls are both fast to build and incredibly durable. Whether for historical restoration or new construction, mastering Galloway walling ensures strength, speed, and a distinctive aesthetic. </p>

            <p id="cornish-hedge" className='text-green-600 text-lg mt-4'><strong>Cornish Hedge</strong></p>
            <div className='w-full flex justify-center mt-2 mb-4'>

      className='max-h-60 max-w-60 md:max-w-80 md:max-h-80 lg:max-h-96 lg:max-w-96'
       />
      </div>
            <p className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>The Cornish hedge is a unique type of wall found predominantly in Cornwall, England. It combines elements of a stone wall with a living hedge, creating a biodiversity-friendly barrier. The construction involves building a stone wall with an earthen core, often topped with soil and planted with native shrubs and plants. Over time, the hedge grows and interweaves with the stones, providing a robust, living structure that supports local wildlife and plant species.

            <p id="ha-ha" className='text-green-600 text-lg mt-4'><strong>Ha-ha</strong></p>
            <div className='w-full flex justify-center mt-2 mb-4'>

       />
      </div>
            <p  className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>
A ha-ha is a type of landscape feature that serves as a boundary without obstructing views. A dry stone ha-ha consists of a ditch with a stone retaining wall on the inner side, blending seamlessly into the landscape. This design allows for an unobstructed view across the terrain while still providing an effective barrier to livestock. Ha-ha's are often found in large estates or landscaped gardens, preserving aesthetic appeal while fulfilling practical purposes.

       />
      </div>
            <p className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>Field walls are traditional agricultural boundaries constructed from locally sourced stones. These walls are built to enclose fields, providing protection from livestock and defining property lines. The stones are typically placed without mortar, relying on careful placement and interlocking shapes for stability. Field walls vary in height and thickness depending on their specific use and regional construction practices.

       />
      </div>
            <p className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>Retaining walls are engineered structures designed to hold back soil and prevent erosion. These walls are essential in landscaping and construction projects where there are significant changes in elevation. They can be made from various materials, including stone, concrete, and wood. Retaining walls are built to withstand the lateral pressure of the soil they are holding back and are often reinforced with additional features like drainage systems to manage water flow and reduce hydrostatic pressure.

            <p className='text-md font-normal text-white mb-10'>In addition to the more common varieties, the UK showcases several specialized dry stone walls, each tailored to unique environmental and functional needs. Cripple Hole walls, for instance, feature gaps that allow small animals to pass through, promoting local wildlife movement. Turf-Capped walls are topped with a layer of turf, enhancing stability and helping the wall blend naturally into the landscape. In regions where large boulders are plentiful, walls constructed from singular massive stones are prevalent, utilizing the natural abundance of materials. These specialized walls highlight the creativity and adaptability of traditional construction methods, reflecting the diverse demands and conditions across different landscapes.  </p>
